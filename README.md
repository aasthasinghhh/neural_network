Neural Network Implementations for IRIS and MNIST Datasets

This project demonstrates the application of neural networks to two classic machine learning datasets:

IRIS Dataset:
- Multi-layer feedforward network with 4 input units, 7 hidden units, and 3 output units
- Trained over 1000 epochs using backpropagation (learning rate: 0.10)
- Performance evaluated on cumulative training error and test set accuracy

MNIST Dataset:
- Processes 70,000 hand-written digit images (28x28 pixels)
- Implements custom data loading from CSV files
- Neural network training with progress tracking
 -Initial results: 40% accuracy after one epoch (90 minutes on MacBook Pro 2021)

The project showcases neural network architecture, training processes, and performance evaluation on varying dataset sizes.
